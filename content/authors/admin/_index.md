<!--StartFragment-->

I am a researcher and Ph.D. candidate at the Quality Engineering Lab, Department of Computer Science, University of Innsbruck (UIBK). I hold a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the prestigious University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria and a joint master of science in engineering degree in Software Engineering from University of Tartu and Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia with a specialization in Embedded and Real-time Engineering under a full tuition-waiver scholarship.

My PhD bothers on run-time behaviors of software-intensive systems (a cool way of saying physical systems that are software driven) in a bid to proffer risk assurance and testing solutions in dynamic and uncertain circumstances and environments. These systems include but not limited to cyber-physical systems (CPS), self-adaptive systems, collaborative artificial intelligence systems (CAIS) and autonomous systems. I also supervise bachelors and masters students' seminars and theses. In the future, I will be involved in teaching and will be sure to let you know.

​Before joining UIBK, I was engaged as a Test Engineer in the RF domain at Ericsson Eesti AS maintaining hardware testing systems and providing technical support for production of classical radio equipment. I have also previously worked as an Audit Analyst with KPMG Professional Services Limited, Nigeria in the Financial services sector. At the same rate, I have been engaged as a Management Engineer in a trainee capacity and doubled as a Laser Survey Engineer with Ariosh Limited, a leading oil and gas EPCI company in Nigeria.

I am a big participator in sustainability and an advocate for the realization of the UN SDGs against 2030. Consequently, I am actively involved in social entrepreneurship, volunteering, startups, hackathons, charity and collaborations. At the moment, I am affiliated with CareerEdu, United Youth for Sustainable Growth (UYSG) Nigeria (Lagos chapter) and Green Globe Initiative (GGI) serving in various executive functions ranging from advocacy to research and development.
