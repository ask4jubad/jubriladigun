abstract: Collaborative artificial intelligence systems (CAISs) aim to work with
  humans in a shared space to achieve a common goal, but this can pose hazards
  that could harm human beings. We identify emerging problems in this context
  and report our vision of and progress toward a risk-driven assurance process
  for CAISs.
