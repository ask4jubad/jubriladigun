abstract: Metamorphic testing has proven to be effective for test case
  generation and fault detection in many domains. It is a software testing
  strategy that uses certain relations between input-output pairs of a program,
  referred to as metamorphic relations. This approach is relevant in the
  autonomous systems domain since it helps in cases where the outcome of a given
  test input may be difficult to determine. In this paper therefore, we provide
  an overview of metamorphic testing as well as an implementation in the
  autonomous systems domain. We implement an obstacle detection and avoidance
  task in  autonomous drones utilising the GNC API alongside a simulation in
  Gazebo. Particularly, we describe properties and best practices that are
  crucial for the development of effective metamorphic relations. We also
  demonstrate two metamorphic relations for metamorphic testing of single and
  more than one drones, respectively. Our relations reveal several properties
  and some weak spots of both the implementation and the avoidance algorithm in
  the light of metamorphic testing. The results indicate that metamorphic
  testing has great potential in the autonomous systems domain and should be
  considered for quality assurance in this field.
